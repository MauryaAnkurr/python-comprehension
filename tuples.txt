A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.

Change Tuple Values-
Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.
But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for x in thistuple:
  print(x)
_____________________________________________________________________________
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
if "apple" in thistuple:
  print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits tuple")
__________________________________________________________
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))

Note: You cannot remove items in a tuple.
Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it, but you can delete the tuple completely:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
del thistuple
print(thistuple) #this will raise an error because the tuple no longer exists

A tuple can also be created without using parentheses. This is known as tuple packing.
print(my_tuple)   # Output: 3, 4.6, "dog" 
print(type(my_tuple))
# tuple unpacking is also possible
a, b, c = my_tuple

print(a)      # 3
print(b)      # 4.6 
print(c)      # dog
